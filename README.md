## A Word about platforms

Although versions of `Visual Studio Code` exist for Linux and Mac OSX, only Windows allows Kodi to be installed in a fully [Portable Mode](https://kodi.wiki/view/Portable_mode), which is required for full functionality with `debugpy`.  There is a way to use Kodi Portable Mode on Mac OSX but it is only recommended for very experienced developers and makes for a frustrating workflow since every time you make a change the entire bundle is replaced and you will lose any existing portable data. Kodi for Linux does not support Portable Mode at all. For this reason this addon will only install on Kodi for Windows or Mac OSX, with the former the preferred platform. If you are a developer testing your code on multiple Kodi versions you need Portable Mode, and only Kodi for Windows does this properly. Even if you only want to debug your code in a single version of Kodi, source code editing while debugging only works with Kodi in Portable Mode. If you try to use it with Kodi installed the default, non-portable way then you can step through your code but this will happen in a read-only window instead of a fully functional editor.

This plugin has only been tested on Windows x64 and is not guaranteed to work at all on Mac OSX. If you wish to code and debug on Linux it is recommended you use `Web-PDB` instead of `debugpy` since it works on all platforms.

## debugpy vs. Web-PDB

Prior to Kodi version 19 (Matrix) a wrapper addon for debugpy's predecessor `pydevd` was available in the main Kodi repository to debug Kodi addons and plugins from Visual Studio (`VS`) and Visual Studio Code (`VSCode`). When Kodi migrated to Python 3.x with Matrix that addon was no longer functional, and since `pydevd` was deprecated by then in favour of `debugpy`, it was never updated for Kodi 19+.

Luckily Roman Miroshnychenko stepped in with a browser-based solution called [Web-PDB](https://github.com/romanvm/kodi.web-pdb). This required developers to edit their addon code with one tool but then launch a web browser to catch breakpoints and display code with the current runtime value of variables. `Web-PDB` provides the basic essential set of features for debugging and a host of Kodi addon developers have used it with great success, but there is no link between the code editor and the debug tool and its functionality is limited compared to more robust solutions such as the `VS` and `VSCode` dubuggers. `Web-PDB` lets you insert breakpoints in code, `Step over`, `Step into`, `Step out`, and `Continue`. It also shows global and local variables at each step and allows evaluation of ad-hoc python expressions with access to all imported libraries and in-scope variables. That's enough to be useful when debugging your addon code, but it falls well short of other modern debugger tools.

 `Web-PDB` doesn't have...

* Watch expressions (easily view just the things you are interested in every time execution breaks)
* Call stack (how did execution get to this breakpoint?)
* Persistent breakpoints which can easily be set, disabled, and cleared right in the source code editor
* Conditional breakpoints (break execution when something specific happens without changing your code to check for it)

Those last two limitations are mainly the result of the debugger tool being completely separate from the code editor. Also, with no link between the two tools if your debugging finds a problem you can't just fix the code in the debugger window, you have to go back to your editor and find the relevant line to edit, which might be in any of the python files in your project. With better debuggers you step through your actual source files and when you find something you need to change you are already in your editor on the correct line in the correct file.

With `Web-PDB` the only way to put a persistent breakpoint in one of the python files in your project is a call to `web_pdb.set_trace()`, but this requires each file where a persistent breakpoint is needed to `import web_pdb` and add one or more calls to `set_trace()`. Although `debugpy` has a similar function called `breakpoint()` it is rarely needed or used since you can just turn breakpoints on and off in `VS/VSCode` with a click of the mouse.

`Web-PBD` lists all in-scope variables in one of two relatively small boxes for local and global variables. Once you get deep into addon code before breaking those two boxes can get seriously cluttered and it can be really difficult to find a variable you are interested in, especially if some of those variables contain large entities, such as BeautifulSoup results. The lack of a watch expression display is really frustrating in this situation. Often the only way to see what you want free of all the other variable's clutter is to type in an ad-hoc expression, and you have to do that repeatedly every time you break execution.

The combination of `debugpy` and the powerful `VS` or `VSCode` debuggers overcome all these limitations and aggravations.

## Usage

These instructions assume that you have already set up `VS` or '`VSCode` for Python code development and have any associated Python debugger extensions installed (Installing the Microsoft Python extension in `VSCode` automatically installs the Microsoft Python Debugger extension too).

`debugpy` requires four things to operate...

1. The `debugpy` plugin must be installed in Kodi.
2. The addon you plan to debug needs an import requirement in `addon.xml` for `script.module.debugpy`.
3. A few lines of code must be added at the beginning of the top-level python file of your project.
4. `VS` or `VSCode` must have a properly set up launch configuration.

Also, as stated [earlier](#a-word-about-platforms), it is highly recommened that you install one or more Kodi versions in [Portable Mode](https://kodi.wiki/view/Portable_mode) for full `debugpy` functionality.

Instructions for each of these four steps are detailed below...

### Installation

This plugin is an extension of `xbmc.python.module` which means that it won't appear in any Kodi addon searches. There are two ways to install it...

1. Manually "Install from zip file".
2. Install an addon repository that contains `debugpy` and then do step #2 from the previous section.

If you use the second method `debugpy` will be installed automatically the next time you start Kodi. With either method `debugpy` will not show up in `My add-ons` but will instead appear in Settings under `Manage dependencies`.

### addon.xml
Any addon you want to debug needs the following entry in the `<requires>` section of its `addon.xml`...

```
<addons>
    <addon ...>
        <requires>
            ...
            <import addon="script.module.debugpy" />
            ...
        </requires>
        ...
        ...
    </addon>
</addons>
```

As stated [earlier](#installation), if Kodi finds an installed addon with this requirement when it starts up it will automatically install `debugpy` if it can find it in any of the repositories it knows about.

### Python code

In most Python projects using `debugpy` the following snippet is inserted into your Python code...

```
import debugpy

debugpy.listen(5678)
debugpy.wait_for_client()
debugpy.breakpoint() # OPTIONAL
```

The `listen(5678)` line tells `debugpy` to launch a server on `localhost:5678` to listen for connections from the debugger client (`VS` or `VSCode`).

`listen()` is non-blocking so `wait_for_client()` is needed to halt script execution until the client connects. The call to `breakpoint()` is rarely needed since you can just place a breakpoint on any line you want to stop at directly from the code editor.

In most Python projects which start a main process, run for a while, and then stop completely (which destroys the `debugpy` listener), this setup works well, but with Kodi addons there are several problems. Kodi python scripts are executed repeatedly with different arguments in a separate process each time. This is what causes problems with using the standard `debugpy` startup code. After the first pass every time the addon's top-level script is executed again it will attempt to set up a listener on port `5678`, but the previous listener was attached to Kodi itself, not the process it ran in, and will still exist so the attempt to start another listener on the same port will fail, generating an Exception. Since you can't reconnect to the existing listener from the new process the `wait_for_client()` call will block forever. Unfortunately there is also no way from Kodi to destroy the existing listener and create a new one, so setting up `debugpy` this way will only work the first time the script is called. On the very next execution of the script `debugpy` will effectively block forever and the only way to recover is to exit Kodi.

The solution to this problem is to flip the connection and make `VS/VSCode` the listener and have `debugpy` connect to that instead of the other way around.

```
import debugpy

try:
    debugpy.connect(5678)
except:
    pass
```

This time we have set up `debugpy` to connect rather than listen. When execution reaches `connect(5678)` `debugpy` will attempt to connect to the `VS/VSCode` debugger listening on `localhost:5678`. If the debugger is listening `debugpy` will connect to it and your top-level script will continue on, stopping at any breakpoints in it or in any child scripts. However, if `VS/VSCode` is not listening then an Exception is raised, which is ignored by the `pass` statement, and the script continues on, bypassing any breakpoints set in it or any child scripts. We don't need the `wait_for_client()` call this time since `debugpy` will either connect or it won't and we want the script to continue executing either way. This gives us the useful capability to let the scripts run without debugging just by not turning on the listener in `VS/VSCode`.

### Debug launch configuration

Since most Kodi addon developers will be using `VSCode` rather than `VS` these instructions will show how to set up a `debugpy` launch configuration for the former, but doing the same for the full `Visual Studio` will be similar.

In `VSCode` with the addon workspace and one of your addon Python files open, click on `Run and Debug` on the left side of the screen or press `Ctrl-Shift-D`. Click the gear icon at the top of the left panel. If you don't see the gear icon that means you don't have a `launch.json` file yet. In this case click the `create a launch.json file` link, choose `addons` as the location for the new `json` file, select `Python Debugger`, and then `Python File`. This will create and open a basic Python `lsunch.json`.

Add a new launch configuration...

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [        
        {
            ...
            Other configuration
            ...
        },
        {
            "name": "Python: Kodi Remote Listen",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "attach",
            "listen": {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 5678
            },
            "pathMappings": [
                {
                    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}\\..\\..",
                    "remoteRoot": "."
                }
            ],
            "justMyCode": true
        },
        {
            ...
            Other configuration
            ...
       }
    ]
}
```

Notice the entry for `"listen"`. If we were using the normal `debugpy` method using `debugpy.listen(5678)` then we would use `"connect"` in the launch configuration instead. You can change `"name"` to anything you like and that will appear in the list of launch configurations. The other entry of note is `"pathMappings"`. This tells the debugger how to find the correct source files to match the ones `debugpy` breaks in. You may need to change the `"localRoot"` entry. The one in this example assumes that Kodi is installed on Windows in Portable Mode, your `VSCode` workspace location is the Kodi addons directory , and you are planning to debug addons under that. If `VSCode` complains that it can't find the source file when debugging this is the value you need to adjust.

## Debugging with VSCode and debugpy

To debug your addon with Visual Studio Code start by creating a `VSCode` workspace in the Kodi `addons` directory. If you haven't done so already add the `debugpy` requirement to your addon's `addon.xml` file as [described above](#addonxml). Open your addon's top-level Python script and add this at the very top of the file right after your other imports but before any executable code...

```
import debugpy as dbg

try:
   dbg.connect(5678)
except:
   pass
```

In the `VSCode` editor set any breakpoints you want by clicking on the left end of the line or use the `Run >> New Breakpoint` menu option to set more sophisticated breakpoints such as `Conditional`, `Triggered`, or `Function`.

Select your new listener launch configuration and use `F5` to start listening. Start Kodi and launch your addon. When `debugpy` reaches a breakpoint you can add expressions to the watch list, edit variable values, and do many more things that just aren't possible using `Web-PDB`.

**IMPORTANT:** One quirk is that you must restart the listener every time your addon finishes executing a pass through its code. Even though your addon process has ended the `VSCode` listener will think it is still connected and prevent any new connections on that port. If you don't stop and restart it between passes then `debugpy` will hang the next time `debugpy.connect()` is called until you stop the listener with `Shift-F5` or the `Disconnect` button on the debugger toolbar. As soon as you kill the listener your script will pick up execution again but won't respect any breakpoints during this pass through since `debugpy` won't be connected. Make sure to turn the listener back on before trying again.

It's easy to get into the habit of pressing `F5` to start the listener, running some function in your addon, responding to any breakpoints, and then pressing `F5` to let your script finish the current pass through before pressing `Shift-F5` to turn off listening. Then if you want to debug the next pass through reenable listening with `F5`. Remember that if the listener is not running when you start some action in your addon then the script will run through that pass as if the debugger and breakpoints aren't there.
